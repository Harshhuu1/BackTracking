Hey, Let's understand the concept of backtracking...
First,take a look at (what is this actually part of)
So it is the subpart of the Recursion-->>
There are 3 Parts of the Recursion->
1). Dynamic Programming
2). BackTracking
3). Divide and Conquer 
So Backtracking is Actually Controlled Recursion->
Like, add one condition for recursion
It is pass by reference + recursion.
Like we use Backtracking when we use Pass by reference, then we use backtracking in Pass by reference 
When we call recursion, then the original string get changed, and to make it again original, we need to again backtrack it.
This is all about backtracking.
There are some of the topics.
How to identify the BackTracking->
1). Choices and Decision
2). All Combinations
3). Controlled Recursion
4). Number of Choices
5). Size of constraints
6). Part of Greedy
7). If in constraints n is small ; 0<n<10
